# ENGG-233-POOL-GAME
In the Fall 2016 semester, students registered in ENGG 233 were required to design and create a fully functional
visual pool game from scratch in Processing as their final project. 

This program expected students to implement multiple menus, sound effects, and momentum functions. All graphics and soundeffects
were either made entirely from scratch, or approved for noncommercial reuse.

Users can simply download the source code, and compile it in Processing to play the game.

This code was edited and designed by Nathan Moton in Fall 2016. ENGG 233 was taught by the talented professors Dr M. Moussavi, 
and Dr. M. Moshirpour.
